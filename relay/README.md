# Relay

A small Cloudflare Worker (the free plan is enough) that does two jobs:

- **Looted-city submissions.** Lets players submit their looted cities from the
  app without a GitHub account. The app sends the list here; the relay files it
  as an issue on the repository.
- **Hourly webmap update.** Once an hour it starts the repository's "Update
  webmap data" workflow. GitHub's own timer for scheduled workflows often runs
  late or skips runs; Cloudflare's is punctual.

Nothing a player submits reaches the shared list by itself. Each submission is
an issue for a maintainer to review and merge.

## One-time setup

1. **Make a GitHub token.** On GitHub: Settings → Developer settings →
   Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens → Generate new token.
   - Repository access: *Only select repositories* → `aomc-elytra-hunt`.
   - Permissions → Repository permissions → **Issues: Read and write** (to
     file submissions) and **Actions: Read and write** (to start the webmap
     update).
   - Nothing else. Copy the token.
2. **Deploy the relay.** With a Cloudflare account:
   ```
   cd relay
   npx wrangler login
   npx wrangler deploy
   npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN    # paste the token when asked
   ```
   `deploy` prints the relay's address, like
   `https://aomc-looted-relay.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
3. **Point the app at it.** Put that address in `SUBMIT_URL` near the top of
   `src/main.ts`, then commit and push. The "Submit looted" button appears once
   it is set.

## Getting notified

Issues filed by the relay are created with your token, so GitHub counts them as
your own activity and does not notify you about them. The workflow in
`.github/workflows/notify-submission.yml` gets round that: when an issue with
the `map-submission` label is opened, the Actions bot comments on it and
mentions the repository owner, which does send a notification.

## Handling a submission

```
npm run looted -- --issue 12    # merge issue #12 into public/looted.json
git commit -am "Add looted cities from issue 12" && git push
```

Then close the issue.

## Hourly webmap update

`wrangler.toml` has a timer (`[triggers]`) set to 23 minutes past each hour. When
it fires, the relay asks GitHub to run `update-webmap.yml`. For that to work the
token needs **Actions: Read and write** on the repository. If the token was made
before this was added, edit it on GitHub (Settings → Developer settings →
Fine-grained tokens → the token → Edit) and add that permission; the token
itself stays the same, so nothing needs re-entering. Then run
`npx wrangler deploy` from `relay/`.

To check it: `npx wrangler tail` shows "Started update-webmap.yml" when the
timer fires, and the run appears under the repository's Actions tab as started
by you.

## Label

Every submission is filed with the `map-submission` label, which must exist in
the repository. List them with
`gh issue list --label map-submission`. After changing the relay's code, run
`npx wrangler deploy` again from `relay/` for it to take effect.

## Limits

- Only the app's own site (`ALLOWED_ORIGIN` in `wrangler.toml`) may call it.
- One submission per visitor address per minute, at most 4,000 cities each.
- Only coordinates and a username-like name are accepted; no free text.
